The physics simulator simulates the movement of bodies in two dimensional space, based on the gravitational forces between them, as well as elastic collisions. A portion of the space represented is displayed on a screen. When two bodies collide, a sound is played, indicating that a collision occurred. Users may interact with the simulator by using switches connected to the FPGA to select different pre-coded sets of initial parameters (the initial velocities and locations). This was implemented on a Nexys 4 FPGA board using Vivado.
